Stuff Dario & Theodor thought of:

+ snow particles
+ wind animation thingy has to come back
+ kill mosters with traps
+ certain monsters can only be killed on certain seasons

# Game

+ Character sprites + animation (files already in repository)
+ Dynamic objects
+ Special tile information (different collision shapes, stairs, teleports, etc)
+ Character rolling

# Map editor

+ Make a new world
+ Toolbox on the side where you can swap between visible layers, pick a tool, see your current tile, etc.
+ Edit one layer at a time.
+ Floodfill
+ Pipette
+ Change brush size
+ Advanced brushes
+ Templates (Pick between presaved and make your own)
+ Copy and paste area (kind of the same as templates)
+ Undo (not super important)
+ Metadata editor (teleports, monsters, objects, triggers, etc)
